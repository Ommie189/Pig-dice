      <h2>How it works:</h2>
      <p>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
        <li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</li>
        <li>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The first player to score 100 or more points wins.</p>

      <h2>Let's Play!</h2>
